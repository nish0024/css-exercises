# CSS Foundations – The Odin Project

This repository is a fork of [The Odin Project's CSS Exercises](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises).

I'm using this repo to track my progress through the CSS Foundations section of the curriculum.

### ✅ Completed Exercises:

- `01-css-methods`
- `02-class-id-selectors`
- `03-grouping-selectors`
- `04-chaining-selectors`
- `05-descendant-combinator`

These exercises cover essential CSS topics like selectors, spacing, and element styling.

More updates coming as I continue the course.
